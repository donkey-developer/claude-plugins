# Security findings lack exploit paths for MEDIUM and LOW severity

**Issue:** #56
**Branch:** fix/security-exploit-paths
**Depends on:** none
**Brief ref:** BRIEF.md Section 2

## Tasks

- [x] **TASK-01: Read current security output format definition and spec**
  - **Goal:** Understand how `prompts/security/_base.md` currently defines the output format for findings, what it says about exploit paths, and what the spec mandates, so the fix closes only the gap
  - **Brief ref:** BRIEF.md Section 2
  - **Files:**
    - Read `plugins/donkey-review/prompts/security/_base.md`
    - Read `spec/domains/security/spec.md` (Design Principle 5.4 — exploit path required)
    - Read `spec/domains/security/calibration.md` (confidence threshold context)
  - **Verification:** You can state the current exploit-path requirement in the prompt and the precise gap relative to the spec

- [x] **TASK-02: Strengthen exploit-path requirement in `security/_base.md`**
  - **Goal:** Update the output format section of `prompts/security/_base.md` to make exploit paths mandatory for every finding that clears the confidence filter, regardless of severity. For MEDIUM and LOW findings the exploit path may be brief (one or two sentences) but must be present. Also add a rule: a finding that cannot be given an exploit path at ≥50% confidence must not clear the confidence filter
  - **Brief ref:** BRIEF.md Section 2
  - **Files:** `plugins/donkey-review/prompts/security/_base.md`
  - **Verification:** `prompts/security/_base.md` contains an unambiguous rule that exploit paths are mandatory for all findings at all severity levels, with guidance on brevity for MEDIUM/LOW

- [x] **TASK-03: Recompile agents and skills**
  - **Goal:** Regenerate all compiled agents and skills so they reflect the updated `security/_base.md`
  - **Brief ref:** BRIEF.md — Verification
  - **Files:** Run `./scripts/compile.sh` from `plugins/donkey-review/`
  - **Verification:** `./scripts/compile.sh --check` exits 0 — no compiled files are out of sync

- [x] **TASK-04: Final verification**
  - **Goal:** Confirm all deliverables for this issue are present and correct
  - **Verification:**
    - `plugins/donkey-review/prompts/security/_base.md` contains a mandatory exploit-path rule applying to all severity levels
    - `plugins/donkey-review/agents/security-authn-authz.md` contains the updated instruction
    - `plugins/donkey-review/agents/security-input-validation.md` contains the updated instruction
    - `plugins/donkey-review/agents/security-data-protection.md` contains the updated instruction
    - `plugins/donkey-review/agents/security-audit-resilience.md` contains the updated instruction
    - `./scripts/compile.sh --check` exits 0
