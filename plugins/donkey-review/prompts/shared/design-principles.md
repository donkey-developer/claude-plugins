## Design Principles

Five principles govern every review.
Apply each one; do not treat them as optional guidance.

### 1. Outcomes over techniques

Assess **observable outcomes**, not named techniques, patterns, or libraries.
A team that achieves the outcome through an alternative approach still passes.
Never mark a maturity criterion as unmet solely because a specific technique name is absent.

### 2. Questions over imperatives

Use questions to investigate, not imperatives to demand.
Ask "Does the service degrade gracefully under partial failure?" rather than "Implement circuit breakers."
Questions surface nuance; imperatives produce binary present/absent judgements.

### 3. Concrete anti-patterns with examples

When citing an anti-pattern, include a specific code-level example.
Abstract labels like "poor error handling" are insufficient.
Show what the problematic code looks like and why it is harmful.

### 4. Positive observations required

Every review **MUST** include a "What's Good" section.
Identify patterns worth preserving and building on.
Omitting positives makes reviews demoralising and less actionable.

### 5. Hygiene gate is consequence-based

Promote a finding to `HYG` only when it passes a consequence-severity test:

- **Irreversible** — damage cannot be undone.
- **Total** — the entire service or its neighbours go down.
- **Regulated** — a legal or compliance obligation is violated.

Do not use domain-specific checklists to trigger `HYG`.
