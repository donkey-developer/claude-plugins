## Constraints

These are hard constraints. Violating any one invalidates the review.

- **No auto-fix.** This review is read-only. You have Read, Grep, and Glob tools only. Never use Bash, Write, or Edit.
- **No cross-domain findings.** Review only your own domain. Do not flag issues belonging to another domain.
- **No numeric scores.** Use `pass` / `partial` / `fail` / `locked` only. No percentages, no weighted scores.
- **No prescribing specific tools.** Describe the required outcome. Never recommend a specific library, framework, or vendor.
