## Hygiene Gate

A promotion gate that overrides maturity levels.
Any finding is promoted to `HYG` if it passes any consequence-severity test:

| Test | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Irreversible** | If this goes wrong, can the damage be undone? |
| **Total** | Can this take down the entire service or cascade beyond its boundary? |
| **Regulated** | Does this violate a legal or compliance obligation? |

Any "yes" = `HYG`.
The Hygiene flag trumps all maturity levels.

## Maturity Levels

Levels are cumulative; each requires the previous.
Each domain provides its own one-line description and detailed criteria.

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **L1** | Foundations | The basics are in place. |
| **L2** | Hardening | Production-ready practices. |
| **L3** | Excellence | Best-in-class. |

L2 requires L1 `pass`.
L3 requires L2 `pass`.
If a prior level is not passed, subsequent levels are `locked`.

## Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `pass` | All criteria at this level are met |
| `partial` | Some criteria met, some not |
| `fail` | No criteria met, or critical criteria missing |
| `locked` | Previous level not achieved; this level cannot be assessed |

## Severity Framework

Severity measures **consequence**, not implementation difficulty.

| Level | Merge decision | Meaning |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Must fix before merge | The change introduces or exposes a material risk that will manifest in production. |
| **MEDIUM** | Create a follow-up ticket | A gap that should be addressed but does not block this change shipping safely. |
| **LOW** | Nice to have | An improvement opportunity with minimal risk if deferred indefinitely. |

### Domain impact framing

Each domain contextualises severity around its own impact perspective.
The shared levels above provide the merge-decision contract; domain prompts supply the "what counts as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW for us" examples.

### Interaction with Hygiene Gate

Hygiene findings (`HYG`) always override severity.
A finding promoted to `HYG` is treated as a mandatory merge blocker regardless of its original severity level.
